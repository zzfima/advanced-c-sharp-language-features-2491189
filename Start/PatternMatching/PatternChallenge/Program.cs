// The rules:
// A Stock trade of 0 shares should be caught and flagged as invalid
// A Stock trade that is less than $5,000 is a 0.1% commission
// A Stock trade that is more or equal to $5,000 is a 0.05% commission
// Any stock trade of 1,000 shares or more is a flat fee of $10
// Any Stock trade of 1,000 shares or more with a value of $10,000 or more is a flat fee of $5
// A Bond trade of 5 years duration is $20, or $15 if the total trade value is $10,000 or more
// Any bond trade of 10 years duration is $12
// A Bond trade of 20 years duration is $10, or $5 if the total value is $5,000 or more
// A Bond trade of any other duration should be caught and flagged as invalid
